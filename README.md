# Search-Engine-Project
This project builds a search engine over job postings and employment-related discussions to compare classical keyword-based retrieval with modern semantic search. Using a large text corpus, we construct BM25 and BERT-based FAISS indexes and evaluate indexing behavior, query performance, and ranking quality.
